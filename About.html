	<p>Hi, I'm Mark, a computer nerd that likes to hit the keyboard with his head until something happens, I dont know what but as long as it works I won't mind.</p>
	<p>But the sad part is that I'm kind of in a shitty place where not alot of people appricate my skills</p>
	<p>I started learning how to code when I around 7-8, most of my <i>humble</i> beginnings I have to thank my father for.</p>
	<p>My father teached me how to code in basic on his old C64, my father was also a computer nerd when he was younger, but as same as me, also was born in a place where our types of skills just weren't appricated.</p>
	<p>So everything he learned, he throw at me, he used to say that I was an imaginative kid, I used to make civilization using just chess pieces, ofcourse in my mind.</p>
	<p>So I got really intrested when he told me that "You can make anything you image, using just a couple of words and a computer".</p>
	<p>So I picked a shit ton of time with my father to learn basic on his old C64, and he also helped me learn C and C++.</p>
	<p>And since 2012 I have token the time to learn how graphics work, I choose learning programming over school, social interactions and well almost anything else.My free time was either thrown away on learning more about graphics and computer science, or just playing video games.</p>
	<p>I made a few friends that I will most likely try to stay in contact for a long time, but we all have diffrent priorites so I know that... well that ain't happening.</p>
	<p>Welp thats it, don't be a stranger <3</p>
