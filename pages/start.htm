        <p>
            These days, you don’t make this kind of media (<u>websites</u>) purely out of <i>love</i>.
            You also make it to show what you’ve built, and to justify the time spent in front of a glowing box.
        </p>
        <p>
            So yeah: this is my portfolio — and also a way to keep my head straight and organize my thoughts.

        <h2>Simple answer: Marko Kazimirović (me).</h2>

        <p>
            I started like a lot of people <b style="font-size: large;">video games</b>. I watched my brother and dad play,
            then one day my brother put me on his lap and showed me how.
        </p>

        <p>
            After that I couldn’t stop wondering how a beige box and a blinking box could show entire worlds.
            I opened Internet Explorer and typed: <u>“How do computers work?”</u>
            That pushed me into logic circuits and the fundamentals.
        </p>

        <h3>Today I mostly enjoy:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <b>Bridging virtual and physical worlds</b> — AR/VR systems that thin the wall between real and virtual.
            </li>
            <li>
            <b>Low-level work</b> — performance, control, and systems you can actually reshape when needed.
            </li>
            <li>
            <b>Graphics / engine fundamentals</b> — rendering, timing, pipelines, and toy engines.
            </li>
            <li>
            <b>Tooling + architecture</b> — reusable, composable systems instead of one-off code.
            </li>
            <li>
            <b>Emergent systems</b> — fewer “a thousand IFs”, more rules that let behavior unfold.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I see programming as an art form, systems unraveling into purely magnificent things using only their creators ideas and thoughts.
            It just might be the only thing that still keeps me wondering.
